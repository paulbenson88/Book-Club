Steps to reproduce:
1. Open `pages/admin.html` as the admin.
2. Start a spin and when a reel is stopped, press the "⟲ Respin" button for that reel.
3. Observe that the Edit button for that reel remains visible (and possibly operable) after respin.

Observed:
- The Edit button is still shown after the Respin action, allowing replacement of a reel while a respin is in progress or after the reel state has changed.

Expected:
- When a reel is respun, the corresponding Edit button should be hidden/disabled until the reel is fully stopped again, to avoid inconsistent state or accidental replacements.

Files to inspect:
- `pages/admin.html` (edit button, respin buttons, edit-choice visibility logic)
- `js/voting.js` (slot machine state handlers and respin logic)

Notes:
- Priority: High — this can cause mismatched winners or confusing admin UX.
