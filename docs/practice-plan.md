# Book-Club Practice Plan (12 weeks)

Goal: Build UX/product skills + light front-end dev, accessibility, teamwork, and portfolio items using the Book-Club project.

Time: 6–9 hours/week (evenings + some weekend time)

Phases
- Phase 1 — Foundations (Weeks 1–4)
  - Week 1: Git & GitHub basics (clone, branch, commit, PR). Create CONTRIBUTING.md and PR template.
  - Week 2: HTML & CSS refresher — inspect site, fix one layout bug, add semantic elements.
  - Week 3: Figma basics — recreate 1 page wireframe, learn prototyping.
  - Week 4: Accessibility intro — run Lighthouse, note top 3 accessibility issues.

- Phase 2 — UX & Prototyping (Weeks 5–8)
  - Week 5: Define 2 personas and 3 user stories for the Book-Club (docs/personas.md).
  - Week 6: Wireframe RSVP + Event flow in Figma; create a clickable prototype.
  - Week 7: Run 3 remote usability tests (record with Loom). Capture problems & quotes.
  - Week 8: Iterate prototype; produce final mock and acceptance criteria.

- Phase 3 — Implement & Test (Weeks 9–10)
  - Week 9: Implement RSVP flow (feature branch). Add semantic HTML, keyboard support.
  - Week 10: Add automated tests: unit tests for form logic + one E2E test (Playwright/Cypress). Add CI run (GitHub Actions).

- Phase 4 — Portfolio & Teamwork (Weeks 11–12)
  - Week 11: Write a case study for the RSVP feature (problem, research, prototype, implementation, usability results). Add Loom demo.
  - Week 12: Final polish: accessibility fixes, README update, setup GitHub Project / milestones, publish demo.

Repo tasks & workflow
- Branch naming: feature/<issue-number>-short-desc
- Small PRs (single feature/fix), add reviewers, link issue.
- Use GitHub Issues for each weekly task, tag with milestone (e.g., "Phase 1").
- Track progress in a GitHub Project board (To do / In progress / Done).
