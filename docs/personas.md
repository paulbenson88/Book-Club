# User stories (examples)
1. As Emily (organizer), I want to create an event and invite users so that I can manage attendance and send reminders.
2. As Sam (attendee), I want to RSVP on my phone in under 90 seconds so I can quickly confirm plans.
3. As Emily, I want to export a list of attendees (CSV) so I can share attendance and follow up outside the app.
