Steps to reproduce:
1. On `pages/admin.html`, choose winners with the slot machine or use the Edit Choice UI.
2. Confirm `localStorage.winners` is updated in the admin tab.
3. Open `pages/voting_poll.html` (member view) or check the poll; the published poll choices are not updated.

Observed:
- Winners are saved locally but not appearing in the voting poll or in Firestore (if used).
- The admin page previously had a Start Poll/Firestore publish flow that appears to have been removed; publishing may no longer occur.

Expected:
- When the lead publishes final choices (or when winners are saved), the voting poll should receive the published choices so members can vote.

Files to inspect:
- `pages/admin.html` (admin UI + publishing logic)
- `pages/voting_poll.html` (member poll UI)
- `js/voting.js` (slot/publish helpers)

Notes:
- Please investigate whether the admin page still invokes the backend publish (Firestore or Apps Script) or if the code path was removed/disabled.
- Priority: High — this blocks members from voting if final choices aren't published.
